# MyVanity

I was reading a blog [here](https://blog.powertofly.com/makeup-and-coding-2595842497.html) from Dr. Faith Wallace that talked about combining makeup with coding. In her blog, her vision was to create a website that helped users choose the makeup for the day based on the color of your choice, and what she came up with is a pretty cute and simple static site [here](https://fwallacephd.github.io/EyeshadowApp/).

As much as i enjoy this blog and her site, i saw several flaws (and several more while developing my site) in wanting to create a site that can help a user chose colors based on what the user wants.

The biggest problem I saw was that there was no database that stored all (or as much as possible) of the data from various companies from various releases. Most companies will release their images for their products and more times than not they are photoshopped and contains multiple shades in one image, rendering the data they publish almost useless for someone like me who is looking for high quality data for their products. In fact the closest database I can think of that would have unbiased and well documented information about products is Christine from Temptalia [site](https://www.temptalia.com/), it's a wonderful resource to see if anything is worth buying and looking at in detail without worrying about photoshopped images or excessive marketing. Yet, what Christine runs is a blog/review site and as much as I love this site, I do find the site difficult to navigate while looking very specific information based on what products i want to look at. So i decided to make a site for myself that shows an easy to view user firlendly site that gives a high level look at products.
